##Welcome to my game "KNIGHTFALL" made by RONIT BUTOLIA for GameDevelopment Club Secy Task


### Contribution
I made the code and the logic behind all animations, UI, player movements. 
I made the pausemenu (in both levels) and the story for the game.


###Controls
> **"A/left arrow"** = move left
> **"D/right arrow"** = move right
> **"E"** = attack
> **"Space"** = Jump
> **Esc Key or Pause button** = Pause/Resume the game

###Extra Features

After GameOver the game is started from 2nd level
The story which is shown after clicking start is skippable by clicking ***"Space"***.
